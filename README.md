## cell-signaling
The price of information transfer in living cells

Here we provide the detail of the [chemical Langevin solution](https://github.com/hincz-lab/cell-signaling/blob/master/chemical_Langevin_approximation.nb) of the enzymatic push pull loop and hence the [algorithm](https://github.com/hincz-lab/cell-signaling/blob/master/derivation_of_Fig_3_D-I.nb) to reproduce scatter points (green and blue clouds) in Fig. 3 of the maintext as follows.
